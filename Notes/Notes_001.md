### What is Machine Learning

- The field of machine learning is concerned with question of howto constructcomputer program that improve themselves with experience
- Computer program said to learn from experience E with respect to class of task T and performance measure P if it's performance at task T as measured by P improves with experience E.
- Design tool could be to write down properly E , T and P 
- so let's say for example, spam filtering     
E => Emails collected 
T => Decision Problem (that, is it spam or not)
P => Accuracy as percentage
- Preparing such program is called training, collected examples are call training set , program is called model and task is of classification.
- So we can say , machine learning is the training of a model from data that generalizes a decision against a performance measure.    


### Practical Machine Learning Problems

- Some practical mahcine learning problems:
	| 1. Spam Detection | 6.Product Recommendation |
	| 2. Credit card Fraud Detection | 7. Stock Trading |
	| 3. Digit Recognition | 8. Medical Diagnosis |  
	| 4. Speech Detection | 9. Customer Recommendation |
	| 5. Face Detection | 10. Shape Detection |
- Classes of problems in Machine Learning:
	1.	Classification :  
		We have labelled data & classes for label.From that, we need to identify labels of unlabelled data.
	2. Regression :  
		Data is labelled with real values instead of label. From data, for given instance of data, predict the values
	3. Clustering :  
		Data is not labelled but can be divided into groups based on similarities between different instance of data.
	4. Rule Extraction :
		Data is used for creating proposition rules.
