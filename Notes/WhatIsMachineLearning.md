- The field of machine learning is concerned with question of howto constructcomputer program that improve themselves with experience
- Computer program said to learn from experience E with respect to class of task T and performance measure P if it's performance at task T as measured by P improves with experience E.
- Design tool could be to write down properly E , T and P 
- so let's say for example, spam filtering     
E => Emails collected 
T => Decision Problem (that, is it spam or not)
P => Accuracy as percentage
- Preparing such program is called training, collected examples are call training set , program is called model and task is of classification.
- So we can say , machine learning is the training of a model from data that generalizes a decision against a performance measure.
